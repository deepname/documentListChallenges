Develop a single-page web application using **Vanilla JavaScript with TypeScript**, utilizing **Vite** for the build process. The application must strictly follow the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern** and incorporate a **centralized state management** system for data consistency.

The core task is to display an interactive list of documents, where each document entity includes a **name**, a list of **collaborators**, a **version number**, and a list of **attachments**.

**Key Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Display:** Present the documents in a **grid view**, ordered by the most recently created first.
2.  **Real-Time:** Implement **real-time notifications** using the native **WebSocket API** to alert the user when new documents are added externally.
3.  **Data Management:** Enable users to **create new documents** and update the central state accordingly.
4.  **Sorting:** Provide controls to **sort** the document list by **name**, **version number**, or **creation date**.
5.  **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
6.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed operations.
7.  **Testing:** Implement proper testing and user feedback for failed operations.
8.  **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation for the application, including setup instructions, API documentation, and usage instructions.
12. **KISS and DRY:** Implement the application using the **KISS and DRY** principles.
